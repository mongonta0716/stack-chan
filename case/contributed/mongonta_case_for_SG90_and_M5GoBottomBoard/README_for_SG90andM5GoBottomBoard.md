## Things to prepare

### Parts

* 3D-printed cases
  * Shell
  * Feet
  * Bracket( There are 2 types for SG90 or MG90S)

  * If you want to combine with M5Stack Basic/Gray/Go/Fire, you need [Power Switch for M5Stack](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/5726/) and [Case](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/6295/) is recommended. Since the power cannot be cut off, it will accelerate the deterioration of the battery.

* Two servos
  * Currently available on:
    * SG-90 pwm servo<br>Recommended is [M5Stack Servo Kit 180°](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-accessories/products/servo-kit-180), which has a shorter cable length.

  * Zip ties

### Tools
  * Precision screwdrivers
  * Hex key wrench (1.5mm and 2.5mm)
  * Cutting nippers

# About MG90S
For the MG90S, we have published a bracket that matches the stock one. However, please be aware of the following problems.

1. power supply is not enough. <br>MG90S may not run on the M5Stack's internal battery alone. In that case, you will need to secure a separate power supply for the servos.

1. Some of the imitations on Amazon and AliExpress have different sizes. <br>Some of them are sold as MG90S, but the dimensions are the same as SG90 and the servo horns are different in size. In particular, if the servo horn is different, it will not fit the SG90 version either, in which case you will need to modify the model for the horn part.

## Update History fo 3Dmodels

- 2023/4/21 add bracket_sg90_v2.0<br>Holes added and dimensions changed to accommodate dedicated boards.
- 2023/3/29 bracket_sg90_v1.0 → bracket_sg90_v1.1<br>Add holes to allow long servo wires to pass through.
